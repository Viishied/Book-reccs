# Book Recommendations

## Econ/Governance
- [They Don't Represent Us - Lessig](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43309161-they-don-t-represent-us?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=uGjMGyIiZe&rank=1) An incredible and comprehensive description of all of the ways the US political system is completely screwed up (which we all can tell and feel, but don't know enough to truly diagnose) and ways it could be changed for the better. I love this, even though I often lean away from US-centric things. The author is so knowledgeable, and because he's so knowledgeable he can actually describe solutions that would genuinely work and could genuinely happen. Even if I'm just daydreaming/fantasizing, the idea of fixing our political institutions is an ecstatic one, and understanding the problems better is very rewarding/enlightening.
- [Why Nations Fail - Acemoglu, Robinson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12158480-why-nations-fail?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=9jLvpF0TLk&rank=1) 
- [Poor Economics - Banerjee, Duflo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10245602-poor-economics?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=zwlqNw029X&rank=1) 
- [Doughnut Economics - Raworth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29214420-doughnut-economics?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=0HXYdgDvSs&rank=1) So, so amazing for people like you and me who have an appreciation for the goals of economics but doubts about the current orthodoxy! It actually made me emotional to read my own thoughts put on a page like that, hearing for the first time that the author and many others felt the same way I did. I must say, however, that it does get unfortunately a tad dense/dry once you get further into the book. Still, so many important ideas and pieces of information in there. 
- [The War on Normal People - Yang](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36204293-the-war-on-normal-people?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=BDX1R1vczY&rank=1) ( / [Forward - Yang](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57282235-forward?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=McqA3agJI9&rank=2)) 
- [Factfulness - Rosling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=IxNL2u9u0m&rank=1) 
- [Doing Good Better - MaCaskill](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398748-doing-good-better?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=vcQ9VsE0vk&rank=1) I think this is a *really* good book if you care about helping others, but aren't already very familiar with effective altruism (EA)! You can definitely learn about the things in this book from other EA sources though. 
- [The Triumph of Injustice - Saez, Zucman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45894166-the-triumph-of-injustice?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=mHMAE2EPvF&rank=1) We all know that the rich are paying way, way less in taxes than the rest of us (proportionally) when it's meant to be the other way around, but Saez and Zucman in this book describe exactly what the discrepancy is, how they reduce their tax burden, the history of its evolution, how they get favorable tax code passed, and how the world could start effectively pushing things back in the other direction. That said, obviously not super interesting unless you happen to really care about that stuff! 
- [Arguing With Zombies - Krugman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45894180-arguing-with-zombies?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=YO2dzoO8Ss&rank=1) 
- [Radical Markets - Weyl, Posner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36515770-radical-markets?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=5br31lw7FP&rank=1) Very interesting, though as advertised, very radical ideas! Quadratic voting is particularly cool. 
- [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Ge5TGXRq1B&rank=1) Just started this but it seems really great so far!

## Self:
- [The Craving Mind - Judson Brewer](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32714199-the-craving-mind) Such an amazing book, which totally buries the lead but ends up being 1/3rd about addiction, 1/3rd about the neuroscience behind meditation (default mode network etc), and 1/3rd about mindfulness more generally. So glad I happened to pick this up, and I recommend it to people all the time! Seems like you're really into mindfulness already, though, so maybe it'll be slightly repetitive, but also maybe not!
- [How Not To Die - Michael Greger](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663961-how-not-to-die) Can also just watch his 'Talks at Google' [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rNY7xKyGCQ) for a condensed version/intro and use his [site here](https://nutritionfacts.org/). I think we have to, obviously, be very very careful about people doling out nutrition 'facts' given what an incredibly difficult field it is to truly identify causual relationships, and how profitable it is to be a youtube diet guru, but honestly this guy is just so meticulous and intellectually honest that I love him to death. I'm not sure anything other than the mass of condensed medical research around diet and disease that he presents could have ever gotten me to quit meat (*maybe* the moral side of it would have hit a critical mass in me, but probably not for many more years). 
- [Flow - Csikszentmihalyi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow) 
- [Get to the Point! - Schwartzberg](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34057051-get-to-the-point?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=aDzuyZn1iA&rank=2) (Very concise--80 or 100 pages) and [On Writing Well - Zinsser](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=GxTlbLG60g&rank=1) 
- [Why We Sleep - Walker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=hRKWIUOqNO&rank=1) I have very mixed feelings about this book because I learned after the fact that [it's incredibly intellectually dishonest](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/), which I strongly resent, but it also--like Greger did for my diet--made my sleep habits 10x healthier almost overnight. So I don't know. Big asterisk next to this one.
